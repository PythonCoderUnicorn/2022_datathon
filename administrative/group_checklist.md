# Group checklist

1. Does every group member have access to R and RStudio?
2. Does every group member have a GitHub account and know how to access the [Git repo](https://github.com/rladiesPHL/2022_datathon/)?
3. Does every group member have access to the R-Ladies Philly Slack workspace? (sign up [here](http://bit.ly/join-rladies-slack))
4. Create a Slack channel for your group in the R-Ladies Philly Slack workspace and invite all members.
5. Add your names, slack IDs, and GitHub IDs to [this list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17n4l_eEuVHglAAJQv4S1kJxZgyyeZCx4IVMIPFF9aJA/edit?usp=sharing) (new rows can be added)
5. Who is the group leader?
6. How do you plan to keep track of group progress? (e.g. updating each other in a Slack channel or scheduled (virtual) meetings?)
7. Are group members going to be assigned specific tasks? (e.g. working on a specific sub-question, submitting the final report, delivering the final presentation)
