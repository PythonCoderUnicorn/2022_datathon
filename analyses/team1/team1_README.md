Team 1: ElderNet's impact in the community

- How has ElderNet helped clients remain in their home longer?
- How well is ElderNet connecting participants to the public benefits they need? (consider number of interactions, type of benefits/assistance provided, duration between ElderNet enrollment and first ride or first pantry interaction)
- How do the counties served by ElderNet compare to similar counties where services like ElderNet are not available? (e.g. combine with Census data)
