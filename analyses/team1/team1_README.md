## Team 1: ElderNet's impact in the community

- How has ElderNet helped clients remain in their home longer?
- How well is ElderNet connecting participants to the public benefits they need? (consider number of interactions, type of benefits/assistance provided, duration between ElderNet enrollment and first ride or first pantry interaction)
- How do the counties served by ElderNet compare to similar counties where services like ElderNet are not available? (e.g. combine with Census data)

### Contributing Code

The suggested GitHub workflow is for one team member to fork the repo, and then everyone on the team collaborates on that fork. Upon completion of DataThon, Team 1 will do a single pull request to move the code from the forked repo to the main repo.
 
The forked repo Team 1 will be using is: https://github.com/brndngrhm/2022_datathon. 

To **contribute code** to this fork, please use the following steps:

 * clone the forked repo, https://github.com/brndngrhm/2022_datathon, to your local computer
 * open your local version of the repo in Windows Explorer or Finder and create a folder in the `analyses/team1` directory with your name, for example: `analyses/team1/brengan_g`
 * move any existing work into that newly created folder and commit
 * as the project evolves, other folders may be created in the `analyses/team1` directory for specific tasks, helper functions or cleaned datasets

If you run into issues or have questions there are some GitHub resources on the [DataThon repo](https://github.com/rladiesPHL/2022_datathon#faq), or post them Slack.
