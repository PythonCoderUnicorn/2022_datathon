### Questions

how to identify people?
 * Lower Merion police dept refers a lot of people
 * some from Dr offices, hospitals...
 * some family members
 * self referrals
 
funding sources
 * Gov't contracts, foundation support, individual giving split evenly
 * its good to be this diversified
 
whats worked well in the past?
 * most are long time supporters
 * some hospitals
 * in own community its known, but need to spread the message to those who don't know about ElderNet

Outcomes
 * hard to say, people come until they no longer do (recovering from surgeries)
 * some are around for 20 years some for 8 months

utilized social determinants of health factors data
 * no
 
metrics?
 * if someone accessing a service, how much does it help? how long are people able to stay in their home thanks to eldernet?
 * already using?
  * nothing fancy, just counts
  
outside of Montgomery county?
 * funding sources come from there so they need to stick there
 
Risks
 * staffing
 
without ElderNet
 * mainly Gov't sources
 * forced into nursing home/institutional care setting
 * but nothing as unique as ElderNet
