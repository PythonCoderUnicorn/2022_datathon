Team 3: Growth Opportunities and Interesting Observations

- Are there areas of need that ElderNet should focus on in the future? (e.g. you can use Census data to provide an in-depth picture by county/zip code of the population, and their likely needs)
- Explore ElderNet's growth with regard to number of clients, donors/donation amount, etc.
Any other analyses you think would be interesting to do/helpful to ElderNet to better understand their data
